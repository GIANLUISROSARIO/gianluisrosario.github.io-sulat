		<head> Dear Pamili, </head>
			<body>
			I love you mommy and daddy and sister. You did not give meaning to my life, but you mean to my everyday life. <br>
			Haha, so corny. But it's true, there will be no one to exchange your place as my family. I know that I don't  <br>
			express my feelings to you, seriously, it feels like I'm trying to remove myself to all of you, but I am not. <br>
			I want to say I love you everyday, I miss you all so much. I felt so lonely whe I started to the dorm. At first I <br>
			lonely and isolated, but I thought to myself everytime that this little sacrifice is better than being with you all at <br>
			the house but I can't rest.
