               <font size = "8">As much as I want to, I want to say that you're all important to me. 
Your presence is very easy to fade, disappear. Though it's like that, my memories with you cannot be forgotten, 
and set aside, as new friends arise. I love you all, not like fam or family, or something that is close to family. 
You're all like, <i>tropa</i>, someone that can be relied on. I don't want to point out names because I don't remember 
your names, reason is the so called <i> "boss," "master," "dude," </i> and such. Because of those nicknames,
your names are barely remembered. But that is all a joke. I'm very thankful that you all accepted me as a part of your circle, 
you never leave me, or set aside my point-of-views and me, literally, hahaha. Hopefully your lives are in a better situation,
don't get depressed and keep loving us and opening to us. Thank Ya'll. Kaya malaki picture kasi malaki rin sila.</font>
