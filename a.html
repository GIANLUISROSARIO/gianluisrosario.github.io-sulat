                        <p> Dear Pamili,</p>
        <Font size = "30">I</Font> love you mommy and daddy and sister. You did not give meaning to my life, but you mean to my everyday life. <br>
			Haha, so corny. But it's true, there will be no one to exchange your place as my family. I know that I don't  <br>
			express my feelings to you, seriously, it feels like I'm trying to remove myself to all of you, but I am not. <br>
			I want to say I love you everyday, I miss you all so much. I felt so lonely whe I started to the dorm. At first I <br>
			was lonely and isolated, but I thought to myself everytime that this little sacrifice is better than being with you all at <br>
			the house but I'm always sleeping and not talking to all of you.<p>

			I wrote this letter to you becaue in this world, you are the first persons whom accepted me. I never heard you complain about my<br>
			 actions or behaviors that are not approprite. You know what are those and I will not tell anything about it hahahaha. Thank you for <br>
			loving me. Just that is very important to me. I'm a very unorganized person, you know that. This letter is very dynamic, the meaning<br>
			is very spread out in this letter. Hopefully you will get the message that I only want to say that I love you. <br>
